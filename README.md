## My Views - Updated July 2019
- Architectures are heading towards Microservices and Cloud!
- Spring Boot is the most popular framework for developing Microservices
- Spring Cloud provides great options to developing Cloud Native Applications. How well it does is yet to be seen!
- Staying Cloud Neutral is becoming out of fashion
- As a aspiration web programmer, I recommend to learn
	- Java/Python - Be an expert at your language. 
	- Basics of Design - 4 Principles of Simple Design
	- Be good at your IDE - Eclipse.
	- Understand the build tool - Maven.
	- Build one web application with JSP Servlets - Its great to know the basics. 
	- Build one web application with Spring MVC.
	- Understand Spring and Spring Boot in depth. The more you understand them the more you would love them.
	- Build REST Services with Spring MVC.
	- Get comfortable with Frontend Frameworks.
- If you want to move further ahead
	- Understand Microservices architectures! Start with Spring Cloud and AWS.
	- Understand Cloud! Start with AWS or Azure.
	- Understand Containerization - Start with Docker.
	- Understand Functional and Reactive Programming.
	- Understand Kubernetes
	- Understand BigData and Analytics - Start with Hadoop.
	- Understand Messaging - Kafka, AMQP and JMS. 
	- Understand Continuous Integration, Delivery and DevOps.
- Look at the Roadmap Image
